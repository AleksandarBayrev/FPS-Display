Starting with v4.0 this mod will only be developed for the latest Minecraft version available.
It's a lot of work to develop, test, release a mod for 26+ different versions of Minecraft and I don't have the time for that anymore.
Versions 3.x of the mod will still receive bug fixes, for the time being.
